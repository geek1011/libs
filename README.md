# libs
Single-file C libraries (and a few commands) I have written.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mkmbr.c | Generate MBR disk images out of partition images. |
| fatlabel.h | Get and search for FAT filesystem labels. |
| value_waiter.h | Simple wrapper around pthread condition variables. |
| vector.h | Type-safe vector implementation (and some helper functions) using macros. |
| gpio.h | Simple wrapper around the sysfs gpio interface (and a bit more) |
| audio.h | Simple audio playback library (can currently make use of stb_vorbis, dr_flac, dr_mp3, dr_wav, and tinyalsa) |
